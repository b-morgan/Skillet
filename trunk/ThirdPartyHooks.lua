This file contains functions intended to be used by authors of other mods.
I will make every effort never to change the names or behaviour of any of the
methods listed in this file. All bets are off for methods in other files though.

If you would like to see a method added here that would benefit your mod, by all
means contact me and let me know.

Hooking a Method Using AceHook
------------------------------

To hook this routine with an Ace2 mod, use (for example):

    self:Hook(Skillet, "GetExtraItemDetailText")

and write your method:

    function MyMod:GetExtraItemDetailText(obj, tradeskill, skill_index)
        -- get the previous value from the hook chain
        local before = self.hooks["GetExtraItemDetailText"](obj, tradeskill, skill_index)
        local myvalue = "samplething"
        if before then
            return before .. "\n" .. myvalue
        else
            return myvalue
        end
    end

Hooking a Method Without Using AceHook
--------------------------------------

local orig_get_extra = Skillet.GetExtraItemDetailText
Skillet.GetExtraItemDetailText = function(obj, tradeskill, skill_index)
    local before = orig_get_extra(obj, tradeskill, skill_index)
    local myvalue = "samplething"
    if before then
        return before .. "\n" .. myvalue
    else
        return myvalue
    end
end

In both methods, the 'obj' passed in will be a copy of the 'Skillet' main object.

Of course, the action you take with the previous value is entirely dependent
of what the method does. For methods that return text, you should probably
concatenetate the values. For something like Skillet:GetMinSkillButtonWidth()
you should return the maximum of the previous value and you value.

Please remember that there may be multple mods hooking these methods so please
be courteous and make sure not to discard their data, but rather combine it with
your own in as sane a fashion as possible.

============

Reagent = {
    ["name"] = name,
    ["link"] = link,
    ["needed"] = number,
    ["texture"] = texture
}

Recipe = {
    ["name"] = name,

    ["nummade"] = number made, (how many this recipe make)

    ["count"] = number of reagents for this recipe
    [index 1] = Reagent,
    [index 2] = Reagent,
    ....
}

So, recipe.name is the name of the recipe, recipe[1].name is the name of
the first required reagent.

Profession = {
    ["name"] = trade skill name
    ["count"] = number of recipes for this profession
    [recipe 1] = Recipe,
    [recipe 2] = Recipe,
    ....
}

So, profession.name is the name of the profession, profession[1].name is the
name of the first recipe in the profession.

Character = {
    ["name"] = name of the character
    ["count"] = number of professions for this character
    [profession 1] = Profession,
    [profession 2] = Profession,
    ...
}

So, character.name is the name of the character, character[1].name is the
name of the first profession known by that character.

Characters = {
    ["count"] = number of characters
    [character 1] = Character,
    [character 2] = Character,
}

So, characters.count is the number of characters, characters[1].name is the
name of the first character.
